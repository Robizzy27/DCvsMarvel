# Project 3 Evaluation

## Overview

Excellent job on Project 3.  You should be proud of your effort and results.

We had some mis-translations on order of operations (on both sides).  I hope you see the beauty in leaving the rails page working (not perfect, just working), while you go to **another** route to support angular.  I think this became clearer as the separation between rails and angular became apparent.  I my experience, few applications are simple enough that putting it ALL in angular is maintainable.  That said, this app was simple enough and that was a viable alternative.  I submit that if you had used a separate route (the "root" route) for the angular "app", you wouldn't have had quite the confusion of responsibility you encountered.  This would allow you to leave the rails html pages as they were, in a working state.
